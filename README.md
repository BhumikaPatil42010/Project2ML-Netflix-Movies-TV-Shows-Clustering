# 🎬 Netflix Movies & TV Shows Clustering Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on clustering Netflix Movies and TV Shows using Machine Learning techniques.  
The goal is to group similar content based on features such as genre, duration, rating, and country to discover hidden patterns in Netflix data.

This project is developed as part of a Machine Learning & Data Analytics learning project.
